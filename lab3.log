Lab 3, Spell-checking Hawaiian

1. Initial Setup
   locale | grep LC_CTYPE
- used to check were in standard c. Since our output is:
   LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
- we then run the command:
   export LC_ALL='C'
- to change to standard c.

2. Getting Needed Files
   sort /usr/share/dict/words > words
- sort the provided words file on SEASnet servers and sort them, then
write the output into a new file in my current directory (HW3) called
words. The sort command will take the text file and sort it line-by-line.
   wget hhtps://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/cs35L/assign/assign3.html
- copies the assignment html page as asked

3. 'tr' commands
   cat assign3.html | tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
- using the '-c' option in tr means taht the command will target the
complement of the set given, which means everything that isn't in the
range 'A-Za-z' will be replaced by a newline. The range given 'A-za-z'
simply means were matching (or not matching given the -c option) all
alphabethical characters. '[\n*]' means were replacing everything with
a newline. All combined, this command will output everything that starts
with a character (upper or lowercase) while everything else is translated
to a newline character. The actual output is a list of words in the file
with many randomly distributed newlines between them.
   cat assign3.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
- The only difference here is the addition of the '-s' option. This will
replace all repeat characters in the last set with only 1. That means all
the extraneous whitespace in the pervious command won't show up again.
This output gives the same list of words without the random whitespace, in
the same order, each word on its own line. 
   cat assign3.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
- Addition of the piped command 'sort'. Sort will sort using our given locale
(which is standard C as we set it earlier). It will take the output from the
previous command and sort it ASCII-wise (upper > lower case).
   cat assign3.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
- Same as the last command, but the '-u' output will remove any duplicates
found in the sorted output. Extra occurances of things like 'your' will be
limited to one output.
   cat assign3.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
- 'comm' command will compare our output from the previous function to the
words file we created ealier. The '-' in comm simply is a placeholder for
what we are piping in, and words the file we are comaring too. It will 
output 3 columns: 1 = unique to sort,2 = unique to words,3 = in both.
   cat assign3.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
- Addition of the '-23' option in comm means that we will not output the
2nd and 3rd columns, only leaving behind the words in the 1st column, which
are words that are unique to only assign3.html. This is a 'crude'
implmentation of an English Spellchecker

4. Creating Hawaiian Spellcheck
   wget https://www.mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdshw.htm
- Buildwords script:
   1) change everything to lowercase (tr)
   2) remove ?'s (tr)
   3) convert grave accent to apostrophes (tr)
   4) find all table entries = lines with </td> at the end (grep)
   5) remove all html entries (sed)
   6) seperate all words with apsotrophes (tr) with a newline
   7) remove all non hawiian words. Since we are treating words like
      pineapple is ok, we simply use another grep statement searching
      for words only with the hawiian alphabeht
   8) sort the resultant with (sort -u) to remove duplicates.

   chmod +x buildwords
- make the buildwords file executable
   cat hwnwdshw.htm | ./buildwords > hwords
- use the file we got with wget as our input into you script, write the output
into hwords for a hawaiian dictionary.

5. Hawaiian Spellchecker
   tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords
- Virtually the same as the english spellchecker, however, our hwords is all
in lowercase, so we will need to add an extra command before sorting to 
convert everything into lowercase. Obviously use hwords instead of words.

Mispelled words on assign3.html:
ENGLISHCHECKER: 104  
HAWAIICHECKER: 559

Comapre the outputs of both commands with comm:
Englishchecker reports mispelled but Hawaiian doesn't: 67
   comm -23 en ha
Examples: anDrEWs, wiki
HawaiiChecker reports mispelled but english doesn't: 522
   comm -13 en ha
Examples: able, above
